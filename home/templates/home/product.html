                <p>This was one of the best home-made baklava I've had in the US. Buttery, crispy, sweet little bites! 
                    They have the perfect amount of sweetness, delicious nut filling, crispy buttery layers that leave you wanting more and more. 
                    They are moist, but not soggy, and definitely not dry like many baklava you'd find in the US. I ended up eating over 10 pieces in one sitting ;) 
                    Order these, don't wait another second. You can thank me later :)</p>

                <p>It has been very long time since we ate baklava. This one was super tasty and crispy. Owner was so kind and helpful. 
                    Thanks to her we can order time to time for our guest to share this traditional baklava! Thank you Cigdem!</p>

                <p>The baklava is out of this world! It’s not like the baklava you’ve tried before. It’s not sticky and it’s so delicious! 
                    I’ve bought multiple boxes of these, eaten them with my family and delivered them to clients. We’re all in love! 
                    Cigdem is also one of the sweetest people you will ever meet. Try a box and see for yourself!</p>
